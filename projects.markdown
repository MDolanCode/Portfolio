### Detroit-909
December 2020 - April 2021

Project description: Detroit-909 is a project that I started because I wanted to create a drum sampler that would pay homage to the birthplace of Techno, and the Roland TR-909 classic drum machine, hence the name. I started development at the end of December 2020, and was published to the AppStore on April 2, 2021. As of October 2021, it has 100+ downloads.

* This is app is a drum sampler based on Roland's classic TR-909 and it consists of 11 drum pads and sampled sounds. 
* Detroit Techno heavily utilized the TR-909 and helped to make it the iconic drum machine that it is today, so this app pays homage to both. 


This app is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/detroit-909/id1560868575), and the code can be view here on [GitHub](https://github.com/mdolancode/Detroit-909)!

### Hello-and-Goodbye-Coordinators
Mar 2021

Project description: simple coordinator project.

I have previously used coordinators, but it has been a few months, and I needed a review, so I decided to make this small project.

The project demonstrates a simple Coordinator pattern introduced by Soroush Khanlou at the NSSpain conference in 2015. I originally learned the Coordinator pattern from Paul Hudson at Hacking with Swift, and always use his article and video as a reference. The link to his article can be found here. https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps

I hope this helps!
