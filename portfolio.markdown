## Released Apps or Soon to Be Released Apps

### Anime Quotes! Watch App
November 2021 - SwiftUIJam Hackathon

### Project Description 
Anime Quotes! watchOS app, built with the anime lover in mind, and displays quotes on the screen. Every time you open the app on your watch, anime quotes will appear. This app is a stand-alone or used as a companion app with the iOS app of the same name. 

I participated in the SwiftUIJam hackathon, early November 2021, and this app is what I created. I learned quite a bit in a short time, and it was the second time I have used the SwiftUI Framework, but the first time building a watchOS app.  

This app will be released soon to the app store, and the code can be view here on [GitHub](https://github.com/mdolancode/anime-quotes-watch-app)!

### Detroit-909
December 2020 - April 2021

### Project Description 
Detroit-909 is a project that I started because I wanted to create a drum sampler that would pay homage to the birthplace of Techno, and the Roland TR-909 classic drum machine, hence the name. I started development at the end of December 2020, and was published to the AppStore on April 2, 2021. As of October 2021, it has 100+ downloads.

* This is app is a drum sampler based on Roland's classic TR-909 and it consists of 11 drum pads and sampled sounds. 
* Detroit Techno heavily utilized the TR-909 and helped to make it the iconic drum machine that it is today, so this app pays homage to both. 

This app is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/detroit-909/id1560868575), and the code can be view here on [GitHub](https://github.com/mdolancode/Detroit-909)!

### Hello-and-Goodbye-Coordinators
Mar 2021

### Project Description 
A simple coordinator project.

I have previously used coordinators, but it has been a few months, and I needed a review, so I decided to make this small project.

The project demonstrates a simple Coordinator pattern introduced by Soroush Khanlou at the NSSpain conference in 2015. I originally learned the Coordinator pattern from Paul Hudson at Hacking with Swift, and always use his article and video as a reference. The link to his article can be found here. https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps

I hope this helps!
